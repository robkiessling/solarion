# Solarion

### Game link: <https://robkiessling.github.io/solarion/>

Note: This is an **unfinished** game. In fact, it's barely a game at 
all at this point. It was primarily a way to learn about [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) 
and to test ASCII animations. 

## Building game locally

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Game will be hosted on http://localhost:8080.

Note: When I switched to an M1 mac for development, `npm install` didn't work out-of-the-box. 
I had to specify python2 (`pyenv install 2.7.18`).
